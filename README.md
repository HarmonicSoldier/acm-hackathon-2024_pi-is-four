# acm-hackathon-2024
Used by Math Team.  repository for the 2024 UAH hackathon hosted by the Association of Computing Machinery.

Project sought to be a messaging application similar to Tinder, but aimed towards people seeking to make anonymous friends with similar interests.
Users would answer ten general personality questions at the beginning, and the system would match users with people with similar answers.
From there, users would be able to send invites to people who are close matches, beginning a chatting functionality similar to Tinder.
We also have a basic ChatBot feature to simulate the conversational aspect of the program.

Our code is written in Python and was intended to be utilized as an Android application. We recommend running portions of the code using an emulator.

Our project is incomplete and does not run in its current state. 
Due to scheduling difficulties, we will not be presenting.
